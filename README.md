# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This repo was created for the project of Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Course. 

## Download Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UCI website. 

## Run R code to get tidy data.
- Training data and test data were merged to create one data set
- Only the measurements on the mean and std for each measurement were kept.
- Descriptive activity names were replaced in the data set.
- Change some variables name. For example, column names start with t will be replaced with Time; column names start with f will be replaced with Frequency, column names containing Acc, Gyro, Mag, tBody will be replaced with Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Magnitude, TimeBody respectively. () will be removed.
- Tidy data was created based on the data set above, it was a summary with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repo contains three files (Codebook, R code, Tidy data). A codebook describes variables, data and method to clean the data. R code to get tidy data. Tidy data that was generated by the R code.
